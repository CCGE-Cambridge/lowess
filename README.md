# The lowess Package
This package provides a function to perform a LOWESS on Pandas Series objects. 
LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) \[1, 2\] as defined by STATA \[3\].
The regressions utilises some of the methods in \[4\].



## Description



### Methods and Formula
Let x and y be the two variables each of length N, and assume that the data are ordered so that x<sub>i</sub> = < x<sub>i+1</sub> for i = 1,...,N-1.
For each y<sub>i</sub>, a smoothed value y<sub>i</sub><sup>s</sup> is calculated.
The subset of points used in calculating y<sub>i</sub><sup>s</sup> is  i<sub>-</sub> = max(1, i-k) through i<sub>+</sub> = min(i+k, N), where  

k = Floor((N × bandwidth - 0.5) / 2).  

The weights for each of the observations between j = i<sub>-</sub>,...,i<sub>+</sub> are the tricube  

w<sub>j</sub> = [1 - (|x<sub>j</sub> - x<sub>i</sub>| / ∆)<sup>3</sup>]<sup>3</sup>,  

where ∆ = 1.0001 max(x<sub>i<sub>+</sub></sub>-x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>i</sub>-x<sub>i<sub>-</sub></sub>).
The smoothed value y<sub>i</sub><sup>s</sup> is then the weighted polynomial regression prediction at x<sub>i</sub>.

**NB**: In this implemtation x and y should be [Pandas Series objects](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html "Pandas Series").
The series need not be sorted and x and y can be in different orders, so long as their indexes have the same elements. 



### Usage
Once the package has been installed it can be imported into a python script  
`import lowess`  
The package provides a single module `lowess` with a single function `lowess.lowess`.
This function has the signiture:  
`lowess.lowess(x, y, bandwidth=0.2, polynomialDegree=1)`  
where the arguments are:
1. **x** (pandas.core.series.Series): a Pandas Series containing the x (independent/covariat) values. The indices must be unique.
2. **y** (pandas.core.series.Series): a Pandas Series containing the y (dependent) values. It must have the same index as x (although not necessarily in the same order.)
3. **bandwidth** (float, optional): the bandwidth for smoothing. It must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.2
4. **polynomialDegree** (int, optional): The degree of polynomial to use in the regression. It must be >= 0. Default is 1.

It returns a Pandas Series containing the smoothed y values, with the same index as y.

If the input is not valid or an error occurs, a `LowessError` exception is raised.



## Examples
Some examples are given in the directory `examples`.



## Installation
### Via the PyPI package manager
The package can be installed with `pip` via the command:  
`$ pip install lowess`  

### Via GitHub
The package can be installed from source via GitHub.
First download the repository, either via SSH  
`$ git clone git@github.com:CCGE-Cambridge/lowess.git`  
or via HTTPS  
`$ git clone https://github.com/CCGE-Cambridge/lowess.git`  
Then install the package via

    $ cd lowess
    $ pip install .



## Documentaion
Documentaion of the API is provided via Sphinx.
To make the documentaion

    $ cd docs
    $ make html
    $ open build/html/index.html

This may require installation of the package `sphinx`.



## Testing
Unit tests are implemented via `unittest` and are in the file `tests/test_lowess.py`.
To run the tests first download the source code and then run the command:  
`$ python tests/test_lowess.py`
